# FED Portfolio - Vanilla Front-end Website

This is a vanilla website that displays a portfolio made by and for AlexVedt

This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Description

This is my first draft for a portfolio website. I have included my three latest projects iÂ´ve worked on at under my studies at Noroff and will use the summer to update this site to add further styling instead of the minimalistic theme I went for now.

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexvedt/portfolio.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

#### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

In the project directory, you can run:

- install the project node module dependencies $`npm i`
- Runs the app in the development mode. `npm run dev`
- Open `http://0.0.0.0:5173/` to view it in the browser.
